## Instructions

### Installation
Python, Npcap and Scapy are required to run Scapy(Unzip the archive, open a command prompt in that directory and run python setup.py install. on windows.

Just download the files and run the setup program. Choosing the default installation options should be safe. (In the case of Npcap, Scapy will work with 802.11 option enabled. You might want to make sure that this is ticked when installing).

After all packages are installed, open a command prompt (cmd.exe) and run Scapy by typing scapy. If you have set the PATH correctly, this will find a little batch file in your C:\Python27\Scripts directory and instruct the Python interpreter to load Scapy.
